# TODO

**Note**: this is a fork of <https://git.disroot.org/oink/vis-smart-numbers> ; the key mapping with "s" and "S" was conflicting with "vis-sneak" (it was switching to INSERT mode instead of starting the jump).

Get Change Operator to work with smart numbers. Will involve writing a more copmlex function.
